# Gadgets & Gizmos!

### This is a mod that adds three new items to the game: the Digital Watch, GPS, and Battery.

The Digital Watch displays in-game time, the GPS displays in-game position of the player, and the battery can be used to repair both at an anvil when they run out of durability.

### Known issues

The durability restores itself to a certain amount upon reloading the game and entering some menues.

## Have fun! :)
